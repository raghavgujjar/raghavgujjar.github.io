Currently working on `Javascript` a bit of `HTML` and `CSS` controlling the front tier of web applications. This involves writing code that doesn't only get executed on the browser but also on the server. The `node.js` platform has given me the opportunity to write Javascript on the server.

I went to schools to get my degrees in Engineering during which I acquired important skills. The most important them of all being in programming. I learnt some languages in school and some myself. They are important because they help me solve problems and see results almost immediately and positive results through improving the solution.

My other technological interest is in Computer Vision and Image Processing as it solves real world problems by viewing them as images.
